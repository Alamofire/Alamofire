#### Upgrade Notes
This release requires Xcode 8.0 beta 6+ because it has been completely refactored to compile against Swift 3.0. Any older versions of Xcode will **NOT COMPILE**.

This release is the start of the Alamofire 4.0.0 beta releases. We still have quite a few large changes we're trying to squeeze in before the Xcode 8 GM drops, so the APIs will continue to change over the next few weeks. Please keep in mind that each beta will likely bring new APIs and also refactor others. The betas **WILL NOT** follow semantic versioning. We'll most likely conform to semantic versioning once we start releasing the RCs unless we run into a major unforeseen issue.

We'd really appreciate everyone trying out the betas and letting us know if you find issues. We want to address every possible issue prior to the official Alamofire 4.0.0 release.

#### Upgrade Notes
This release requires Xcode 7.3+ otherwise the Swift 2.2 changes will **NOT COMPILE**. There are several reasons why this was deployed as a MINOR and not MAJOR release. First off, the public API changes of this release are fully backwards compatible. There are no breaking API changes in the public APIs. Strictly following semver dictates that this is a MINOR, not MAJOR release.

> See [semver](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-specification-semver) for more info.

We also realize that this can be frustrating for those out there not ready to upgrade to Xcode 7.3. Please know that we consider each release version carefully before deploying. Our decision to bump the MINOR version was not only due to strictly following semver, but also because it's difficult and undesirable for all OSS libraries to bump MAJOR versions each time the Swift APIs are incremented. Alamofire would have had to go through 6 additional MAJOR versions if this was the policy. That would mean we'd already be running on Alamofire 10.x. Incrementing MAJOR versions this quickly is disruptive to the community and would cause even more confusion. Instead, we try to carefully plan our MAJOR version releases and accompany them with detailed Migration Guides to help make the transition as smooth as possible.

If anyone has additional questions, please feel free to open an issue and we'll be more than happy to discuss further.

#### Upgrade Notes
There are a couple changes in the 1.3.0 release that are not fully backwards
compatible and need to be called out.

* The global `request` / `download` / `upload` external parameter naming conventions
were not consistent nor did they match the `Manager` equivalents. By making them
consistent across the board, this introduced the possibility that you "may" need to
make slight modifications to your global function calls.
* In order to support generic response serializers, the lowest level
`Request.response` method had to be converted to a generic method leveraging the new
`ResponseSerializer` protocol. This has many advantages, the most obvious being that
the `response` convenience method now returns an `NSData?` optional instead of an
`AnyObject?` optional. Nice!

  > Please note that every effort is taken to maintain proper semantic versioning. In
these two rare cases, it was deemed to be in the best interest of the community to
slightly break semantic versioning to unify naming conventions as well as expose a
much more powerful form of response serialization.

  > If you have any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out through
