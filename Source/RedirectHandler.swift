    /// The `completion` closure should be passed one of three possible options:
    ///
    ///   1. The new request specified by the redirect (this is the most common use case).

    ///   - task:       The task whose request resulted in a redirect.
    ///   - request:    The URL request object to the new location specified by the redirect response.
    ///   - response:   The response containing the server's response to the original request.
    ///   - completion: The closure to execute containing the new request, a modified request, or `nil`.
